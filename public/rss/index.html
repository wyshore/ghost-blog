She loves birds, and I love an excuse to learn new skills, so it seemed like the perfect match. My plan was ambitious: a fully 3D-printed structure, a Raspberry Pi &quot;brain,&quot; and&#x2014;the part that gave me the most grey hairs&#x2014;integrated solar power.</p><h3 id="stage-1-design-and-material-choice">Stage 1: Design and Material Choice</h3><p>I started with a rough sketch and moved quickly into SolidWorks to build a preliminary reference design. I wanted a solid foundation, so I used a wood panel for the base and 3D-printed everything else on top.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/PreliminaryBirdfeeder1.png" width="1041" height="662" loading="lazy" alt="Smart Birdfeeder" srcset="https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/PreliminaryBirdfeeder1.png 600w, https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/PreliminaryBirdfeeder1.png 1000w, https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/PreliminaryBirdfeeder1.png 1041w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/PreliminaryBirdfeeder2.png" width="1193" height="678" loading="lazy" alt="Smart Birdfeeder" srcset="https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/PreliminaryBirdfeeder2.png 600w, https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/PreliminaryBirdfeeder2.png 1000w, https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/PreliminaryBirdfeeder2.png 1193w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Preliminary SolidWorks Concept, this was just a single part to get a feel for the size and form.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>For the filament, I chose PETG. Most people start with PLA, but since this was going to live outside in the BC weather, I needed something that wouldn&apos;t warp under the sun or degrade in the rain.</p><p><strong>The Roof:</strong> To fit on my print bed, I designed the roof in four quarters. I included custom-profiled cutouts to flush-mount two 3W solar panels I found on Amazon.</p><p><strong>The Hopper:</strong> I designed a flap-and-silo system. You pour the seeds in through a flap on the back, and they gravity-feed into a front silo with a glass window so you can see the seed level.</p><hr><h3 id="solving-the-camera-fov-problem">Solving the Camera FOV Problem</h3><p>This was the most complicated part of the mechanical design. Initially, I planned to put the camera above the seed silo. However, when I modeled the camera&#x2019;s field of view in SolidWorks, I realized it couldn&apos;t see anything up close&#x2014;it would just be a view of the bird&apos;s back at best.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/CameraFOV.png" class="kg-image" alt="Smart Birdfeeder" loading="lazy" width="1262" height="727" srcset="https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/CameraFOV.png 600w, https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/CameraFOV.png 1000w, https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/CameraFOV.png 1262w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Camera FOV on concept model</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The Solution:</strong> I decided to put the camera inside the silo. I designed a hollow &quot;tunnel&quot; that runs right through the middle of the seeds. This kept the camera dry and seed-free while giving it a front-row seat to the action.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/SeedSilo.png" width="916" height="648" loading="lazy" alt="Smart Birdfeeder" srcset="https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/SeedSilo.png 600w, https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/SeedSilo.png 916w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/SeedSilo2.png" width="933" height="616" loading="lazy" alt="Smart Birdfeeder" srcset="https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/SeedSilo2.png 600w, https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/SeedSilo2.png 933w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><hr><h3 id="sourcing-parts-and-electrical-issues">Sourcing Parts and Electrical Issues</h3><p>Sourcing parts was the hardest part of the project (this was before I discovered the magic of AliExpress). I chose a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W for the brain because of it&apos;s small form factor, low power consumption, and it has built-in Wi-Fi which will be essential.</p><p><strong>The Camera</strong></p><p>For the camera, I was looking at a few options that could be connected to the Raspberry Pi&apos;s camera port. I ended up going with the official Raspberry Pi Camera  Module 3, specifically the wide angle version. This 12-megapixel camera&#xA0;is built around the Sony IMX708 sensor with a resolution of 4608 &#xD7; 2592 pixels, and it also has powered autofocus. <br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/rpicam3-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Smart Birdfeeder" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/rpicam3-1.jpg 600w, https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/rpicam3-1.jpg 1000w, https://wyattshore.ca/content/images/2026/02/rpicam3-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The Power System:</strong></p><ul><li>Two 18650 Lithium-ion batteries.</li><li>An Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) module to allow simultaneous charging and discharging.</li><li>A pair of 3W USB solar panels.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p><strong>The Problem:</strong> I wanted to monitor the battery and solar voltage via an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). But there was an incompatibility: the ADC needed to talk to the Pi at 3.3V logic, but the solar panels were pushing 6V and the batteries 4.2V.</p><p>Instead of waiting for a new part, I worked with what I had and designed a custom perfboard add-on with a simple voltage divider circuit (just a few resistors I soldered together) to scale those high voltages down to a safe 3.3V range.

When a bird arrives, it triggers an interrupt, snaps a photo, and sends it to Firebase (a cloud storage/database).</li><li>Another script monitors the firebase database and checks for flags corresponding to commands from the app. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Flutter App:</strong> I used flutter to build a custom app that pulls data from the cloud so we can manage settings, see battery levels, solar voltage, and a gallery of bird photos.
